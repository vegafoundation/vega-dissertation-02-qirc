## Abstract

This dissertation introduces **Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC)** as a 
conceptual computational paradigm that operates entirely on classical hardware while 
using quantum mechanical concepts as mathematical metaphors for multi-level meaning 
processing.

---

## Core Concepts

### Superposition
In QIRC, meaning exists in superimposed states until observation/decision forces 
collapse. This is a conceptual metaphor, not a claim of quantum physics.

### Interference
Constructive interference: Relevant meanings amplify each other
Destructive interference: Irrelevant meanings cancel out

### Resonance Collapse
Decision is modeled as the collapse of superimposed meaning states into a 
single, coherent outcome - not through ranking, but through resonance.

## What This IS

- A conceptual paradigm for multi-level processing
- A mathematical metaphor (quantum-inspired, not quantum)
- A framework for thinking about meaning and decision
- Classical computation with quantum-inspired abstractions

---

## What This IS NOT

- NOT actual quantum computing
- NOT quantum hardware dependent
- NOT new physics
- NOT consciousness or sentience
- NOT implementation specification
